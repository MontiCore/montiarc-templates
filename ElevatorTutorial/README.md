### Checking, Building, And Simulating

For running and building the project you need Java 21.

Either install exactly Gradle 8.5 or add a Gradle wrapper with that version by running:

```bash
./init-gradlew[.bat]
```

To check the models and build the simulator run:
```bash
./gradlew[.bat] build
```

To run the simulation execute: 
```bash
./gradlew[.bat] run
```
